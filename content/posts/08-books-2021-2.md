Here’s the list of books I’ve enjoyed during 2021. Since I’m an avid reader (more than probably I like to write), I’ll try to write down a note about books I liked every year.

  * Linux Kernel Programming Vol 1 and Vol 2 – I try always to keep up to date with Linux Kernel development, reading all the stuff that gets published around the topic
  * Windows 10 System Programming Vol 1 and Vol 2 – One of the best book I’ve ever read about system programming, I’m not a Windows guy (except for music production stuff, but since I like low level stuff and system programming, why not?)
  * Windows Kernel Programming – Well, after reading about Windows user space, why not reading also about its kernel internals?
  * Rust In Action – My journey with Rust continues, this book projects the reader through Rust in the system programming ecosystem!
  * Creative DIY Microcontroller Projects with TinyGo and WebAssembly – I love Go, and I also love MCUs, so a must read for me!
  * The Rootkit Arsenal – Old but gold! Gory details about Rootkits on Windows, book is quite old now, but I think still worth to be read, it’s full of details that yet stick in nowadays
  * Alternate Picking Guitar Technique – Another great book from Chris Brooks, if you want to improve your alternate picking technique this is a must have!

That’s all folks!
